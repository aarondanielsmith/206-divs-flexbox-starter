                <p>I started coding at age 8 after watching a series of Visual Basic training videos with my dad at home. He put me to work at his software company a couple summers later (no, it wasn't legal; yes, I did make enough money to buy parts for my own custom-built PC.)</p>

                <p>I'm from the great wild Pacific Northwest, and as such I love getting any chance I get. I love hiking, backpacking, and cycling. I got into rock climbing last year, and just recently started lead climbing. My goal is to get outside as soon as my schedule and weather allow!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>I am fortunate to play music for a living. In the course of working as a touring keyboardist and drummer, I've been to all 50 states and 13 countries. I love traveling for the food, scenery, people, and sense of adventure.</p>
